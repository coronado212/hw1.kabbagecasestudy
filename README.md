# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study
## **Kabbage Lets Bakers Bake**

### Overview and Origin

It’s no secret that the last recession had a tremendous negative impact on the US economy. However, it’s often said that every problem creates an opportunity, an opportunity that Kabbage did not think twice about capitalizing on. Back in 2009, founders Rob Frohwein, Marc Gorlin and Kathryn Frohwein saw an opportunity to leverage AI to make small business lending more efficient and profitable, as the industry had not seen much innovation, with banks requiring that you meet high standards for cash flow, capital, and collateral. Kabbage decided to review more types of data in order to evaluate the health of a business and lend to a higher percentage 
of applicants. In addition, much less paperwork is required by Kabbage, with no need to provide financial statements, lease agreements, or tax history. They do, however, need to have been operational for a year and have a minimum of $50,000 in annual revenue. Due to the risk that this includes, they do charge more than a bank, but can make a loan decision in under 10 minutes. In the early days, Kabbage focused on eBay businesses and other e-commerce companies, which were (and still are) being ignored by banks. In 2014, they expanded to brick and mortar businesses, and focused on loans under $250,000. 
Kabbage is funded by 26 investors, and has raised a total of $2.5B in funding over 16 rounds, including $250 million last year from Japanese tech SoftBank. Kabbage has acquired 2 companies, Radius Intelligence and Orchard Platform Markets, the latter being a provider of small business lending data.

### Business Activities

According to a Kabbage survey summarized by Forbes contributor Moira Vetter, 91% of small business owners spend as much as 20 hours per week on cash flow management, which varies from payroll to invoicing and purchasing inventory. Kabbage is looking to free up that time, and allow entrepreneurs to use it to grow their business. They also have a high percentage of women and minority applicants, as their process avoids bias by allowing data to make the underwriting decision. The data they receive also enables them to work with businesses and predict their cash flow needs. Although it might sound counter-intuitive, they are seeking to help small businesses borrow less. They understand that some small businesses borrow too much, hold the loan too long, and spend too much in fees, which brings their bottom line down. 
Powered by Artificial Intelligence, Kabbage Small Business Revenue Index is a free tool that analyzes live data of more than 200,000 companies in order to assess how they are performing in real time. This is a huge competitive advantage over others, as they focus on the customer and their true cash flow needs. They use analytics and artificial intelligence to produce personalized forecasts to predict the future cash position of a business. While credit score is taken into account, Kabbage’s algorithm- developed in conjunction with credit-scoring giant FICO-considers 30 data points, which include cash flow and business performance. The algorithm can also learn from historical data, which allows it to become more effective at predicting risk over time. According to BuiltWith, Kabbage is actively using 71 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery. The company’s reliance on algorithms rather than face-to-face meetings proved to be an advantage in a post-COVID world.

### Landscape

The lending domain consists of challenges in two main categories that have not allowed for much innovation, data problems and process problems. When it comes to data, the credit information vendor market is fragmented, meaning financial providers and small businesses do not have a single source of credit information to meet their growing need for quality data. Banks use manual, time-consuming, and antiquated processes for collecting information from borrowers. Once that information is gathered, underwriters spend significant time reconciling and analyzing data from various sources. In regards to the process, small businesses often lack the knowledge of their credit risk and how they can improve their business credit standing. They often lack direction on the bank’s credit assessment process and expectations, and face inconsistent requirements among banks in terms of the lending process, necessary data, and documentation. Some also have difficulty in maintaining current and accurate financial reporting due to manual processes and lack of expertise. Aside from Kabbage, companies like Tyro, Prospa, FundBox, OnDeck, Funding Circle, and Capital Float are some of the top Fintech companies using technology to solve those problems.

### Results

Since its launch, Kabbage has been able to address the most difficult problems faced by small business owners, managing cash flow and obtaining access to capital. They’ve been able to evaluate the transaction activity of a customer over a 90-day period and organize it in an easy-to-understand dashboard. This allows the customer to visualize their net growth without taking time to calculate it themselves. Kabbage customers can also compare their company’s performance to similarly-sized companies operating in their state and industry, which allows them to see how they stack up with their competition. The result is being able to anticipate changes, benchmark their growth, plan ahead and make more confident business decisions of when to cut expenses, invest, or borrow, 
From a numerical standpoint, Kabbage has lent more than $8 billion. For the first 3 quarters of 2019, Kabbage added 42,000 unique customers, far exceeding the 37,000 customers they added in 2018. The company is also developing payments processing that could potentially rival products offered by PayPal and Square. It’s also contemplating deposit accounts that could resemble checking accounts at traditional banks. The main objective is to have these products create a full “cash flow as a service” product suite. Because of all their success, it was recently announced that Kabbage and American Express have entered an agreement, where the terms state American Express will acquire Kabbage’s team and its full suite of financial technology products, data platform and IP built for small businesses.

### Recommendations

If I were to advise the company, I would focus more on the AI technology and algorithms being used to predict the cash flow of a business, and expand on what that product offers. I would focus on creating a model that would benefit startups understand their cash flow, and although they wouldn't be immediate recipients of credit products, they could take advantage of resources that would show them the specific steps they need to take from a cash flow and credit perspective in the next year in order to qualify. This would attract startups that are seeking to grow but aren’t seeking equity financing or venture debt. Helping a company from it’s startup stage will create loyalty, and they are more likely to come back for their financing needs.
